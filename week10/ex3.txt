1) execute permission was removed by chmod a=rw _ex3.txt
2) by chmod u=rwx _ex3.txt and chmod g=rwx _ex3.txt for owner and group respectively
3) chmod g=u _ex3.txt
4) each number in 660, 775 or 777 is for owner, group or other respectively. Let's imagine that either r, w, or x
is 1, otherwise 0. then 7 stands for 111=rwx, 6=110=rw-, 5=101=r-x
